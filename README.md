From the surface, the ocean water looks lifeless. That is until you  dive deep into it. Inside the water, the sun peaks through it's body with rays of light. AS you continue your plunge in the cold and mystic waters, you find yourself inside an underwater ravine. The rocky sides of the ravine gievs you chills yet you barely just started your journey. The next second, a school of small yellow fish breeze by you as if they were in a hurry. If only you had a another second, you could have snapped a quick picture of them. As you continue swimming, you uncover a gigantic and majestic manta ray. Whilsts it basks its glory to you, you reach for your camera to take a photo of it. It finally decides to swim away, leaving you dazzled in the ocean's life. Few minutes pass by, you eventually find yourself in the realms of an abandoned ship. Despite seeing the life of the ocean, this is the first time where it contains something unlively. It's rusted exteriors flak off whilst the ship sits there motionless. You realize that your time is up, and you have to return to the surface. It's night-time, the moon and stars are out. The moonlight shine over the water, causing the sky to reflect over the water. It makes you wonder, if the sky is just as full of life as down under...
